## Image Compression using FFT

### Project Overview

This project implements image compression techniques using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It explores the use of FFT for transforming images into frequency domain, where compression can be achieved by discarding less significant frequency components.

### Features

* **Image Compression:** Utilizes FFT to perform frequency-based image compression.
* **Image Processing:** Implements algorithms to process images before and after compression.
* **Visual Comparison:** Provides visual comparisons of original images and compressed versions to assess the effectiveness of the compression techniques.

### Installation

This project utilizes MATLAB for image processing and analysis. Make sure MATLAB is installed on your system.

### Usage

1. **Open MATLAB.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory.**
3. **Run the MATLAB scripts:**
    * `pjt.m`: This script provides a basic implementation of the image compression technique.
    * `project.m`: This script may offer more advanced or refined approaches to image compression.
4. **Inspect the output:** The scripts will typically display the original and compressed images, allowing you to visually assess the results.

**Note:** 
* The `imc1.jpg`, `imc2.jpg`, `imc3.jpg`, `ic1.jpg`, `ic2.jpg`, `ic3.jpg`, `image1.jpg`, and `image.jpg` files likely serve as input images for the compression process.
* The `Image Compression Using FFT.pdf` and `Image Compression  ppt.pdf` files may contain additional documentation or presentations related to the project.
